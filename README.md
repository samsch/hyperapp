Hyperflux is a JavaScript library for state management, using [Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperflux/hyperflux)'s code.

* **Pragmatic** — Hyperflux holds firm on the functional programming front when managing your state, but takes a pragmatic approach to allowing for side effects and asynchronous actions.
* **Debouncing** — Multiple synchronous actions will only cause the onChange trigger to happen once. Updates are always asynchronous.
